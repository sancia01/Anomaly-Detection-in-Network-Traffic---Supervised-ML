# Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic---Supervised-ML

In today's digital world, networks are the backbone of every organization's operations. However, with the rise in cyber threats, ensuring the security of network traffic has become more challenging than ever. Every day, organizations face various types of attacks, such as unauthorized logins, data breaches, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. These threats can be sophisticated and often bypass traditional security measures. Imagine a large company with thousands of devices connected to its network. Each device sends and receives data constantly. The challenge is that among this massive flow of data, there might be malicious activities disguised as regular traffic. Detecting these hidden threats manually is nearly impossible due to the sheer volume of data and the complexity of modern attacks. In this context, there was a pressing need for an advanced system that could automatically identify unusual patterns in network traffic and alert security teams about potential threats. Traditional methods, like simple rule-based systems, were not sufficient to handle the evolving nature of these threats. They lacked the capability to adapt to new, unknown types of attacks and often generated too many false positives, overwhelming security teams.

My task was to develop a machine learning-based anomaly detection system to enhance network security. The goal was to build a model that could effectively distinguish between normal network traffic and potentially harmful activities. This involved identifying anomalies, which are deviations from normal network behavior that could signify an attack or unauthorized access.
